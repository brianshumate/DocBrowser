DocBrowser Plugin
=================

This is a PhoneGap plugin that allows for loading and browsing PDF of documents from within a PhoneGap based application.

It is a modified version of the ChildBrowser plugin and is therefore based on code by Jesse McFayden and Nitobi.

Additionally, Giacomo Balli provided assistance in getting this initial verison working.

INSTALLATION
============

As with any PhoneGap plugin, import the plugin bits into your project and use the JavaScript (`DocBrowser.js`) in the web portion of your app.
